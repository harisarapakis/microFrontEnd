# Micro Frontend Application

This project is a micro frontend application built using React.

## Introduction

The Micro Frontend Application is a modular application architecture pattern where multiple frontend applications (micro frontends) are composed to form a single user interface. Each micro frontend is developed, deployed, and maintained independently, allowing for better scalability, maintainability, and team autonomy.

## Features

- **Modularity:** Split the application into multiple micro frontends, each serving a specific feature or business domain.
- **Independent Development:** Develop, test, and deploy micro frontends independently, enabling parallel development workflows.
- **Loose Coupling:** Micro frontends communicate with each other through well-defined APIs or events, reducing dependencies between modules.
- **Scalability:** Scale individual micro frontends based on demand without affecting the entire application.
- **Team Autonomy:** Enable different teams to work on different micro frontends, allowing for faster iteration and innovation.

## Installation

To set up the micro frontend application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies by running `npm install`.
4. Start the development server by running `npm start`.
5. Open your web browser and visit the application URL.

## Usage

- **Navigate:** Explore different sections of the application by navigating through routes or links.
- **Interact:** Interact with various micro frontends to perform specific tasks or access different features.
- **Customization:** Customize the application by adding, removing, or modifying micro frontends as needed.
